# catan_applet
This project is the final project for the CS201 Class at Middlebury College. In this project, my parter and I
attempted to make a minimum viable product of the popular Settler's of Catan board game. This program is coded in
Java using the AWT package.

## Struggles:
We bit off more than we could chew with this applet. 

1. The hexagonal coordinate system was diffcult to design. There needed to be a system to determine adjacent tiles for implementing the roads and game-play rules. We designed a system for these calculations that can be seen in the `ops.java` file. 
2. JavaAWT is an **outdated** framework so you have to download an old version of Firefox **AND** disbale the security preferences!

## Lessons:
1. Learned a lot about structuring an OOP program and implementing complex original classes. 
2. Perserverance when you've realized you have bitten off more than you can chew and you have other finals to prep for. 
3. Excitement for building coding projects and working in a team.
